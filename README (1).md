## 🔍 How It Works

### Detection Pipeline

1. **Text Preprocessing** - Converts email content to lowercase and analyzes patterns
2. **Feature Extraction** - Simulates TF-IDF vectorization with keyword detection
3. **Indicator Analysis** - Scans for phishing and legitimate email indicators
4. **Risk Scoring** - Calculates confidence based on detected patterns
5. **Classification** - Categorizes emails as Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing

### Detection Indicators

**Phishing Indicators:**
- Urgent action requests
- Suspicious URLs and domains
- Generic greetings
- Grammar and spelling errors
- Requests for sensitive information

**Safe Email Indicators:**
- Personalized content
- Legitimate sender domains
- Professional formatting
- Clear contact information
