## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Save
3. **Access your app** at: `https://your-username.github.io/phishing-email-detector`

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-email-detector.git
cd phishing-email-detector

# Start a local server
python -m http.server 8000
# OR
npx serve .

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 3: One-Click Deploy

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Converts email content to lowercase, analyzes patterns
2. **Feature Extraction**: Simulates TF-IDF vectorization with keyword detection
3. **Indicator Analysis**: Scans for phishing and safe email indicators
4. **Risk Scoring**: Calculates confidence based on detected patterns
5. **Classification**: Categorizes as Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Load Sample Emails**: Click preset buttons to try different email types
2. **Paste Your Content**: Add any email text in the textarea
3. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Email" for instant results
4. **Review Results**: Check confidence scores and detected indicators
5. **Learn**: Read educational tips to improve phishing awareness

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Indicators

Edit `app.js` and modify these arrays:

```javascript
const phishingIndicators = [
    'urgent', 'immediate', 'expire', 
    // Add your indicators here
];

const safeIndicators = [
    'meeting', 'reminder', 'update',
    // Add your indicators here
];
```

### Changing Colors/Themes

Modify CSS variables in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3b82f6;
  --success-color: #10b981;
  --danger-color: #ef4444;
  /* Customize colors */
}
```
